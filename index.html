  AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a script tag.
 
  Features
		-> AngularJS is a powerful JavaScript based development framework to create RICH Internet Application(RIA).

		-> AngularJS provides developers options to write client side application (using JavaScript) in a clean MVC(Model View Controller) way.

		-> Application written in AngularJS is cross-browser compliant. AngularJS automatically handles JavaScript code suitable for each browser.

		-> AngularJS is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world. 
		
   Core Features

		-> Data-binding 
		-> Scope 
	    -> Controller 
		-> Services 
		-> Filters 
		-> Directives  
		-> Routing 
		-> Deep Linking 
		-> Dependency Injection 
		
		
Advantages of AngularJS
-> AngularJS provides capability to create Single Page Application in a very clean and maintainable way.
-> AngularJS provides data binding capability to HTML thus giving user a rich and responsive experience
-> AngularJS code is unit testable.
-> AngularJS uses dependency injection and make use of separation of concerns.
-> AngularJS provides reusable components.
-> With AngularJS, developer write less code and get more functionality.
-> In AngularJS, views are pure html pages, and controllers written in JavaScript do the business processing.
-> AngularJS applications can run on all major browsers and smart phones including Android and iOS based phones/tablets.


Disadvantages of AngularJS
-> Not Secure - Being JavaScript only framework, application written in AngularJS are not safe. Server side authentication and
   authorization is must to keep an application secure.
-> Not degradable - If your application user disables JavaScript then user will just see the basic page and nothing more.
		
		
 1. Modules
   
 -> An AngularJS module defines an application.
	 
 -> The module is a container for the different parts of an application.
     
 -> The module is a container for the application controllers.
 
 ->Syntax : var app = angular.module("myApp", []);


   2. Expression
	
->  AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

->  AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive: ng-bind="expression".

->  AngularJS will resolve the expression, and return the result exactly where the expression is written.

->  Example

   Using Double Braces {{4+4}} 
   
   Using ng-bind  value is <span ng-bind="value1+value2"></span>
  
  3. Directives
  
-> AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.

->  AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which offers functionality to your applications.

->  AngularJS also lets you define your own directives.
  
->  Some inbuilt directives are 
      + ng-model
	  + ng-app
      + ng-init	 
      + ng-bind
      + ng-repeat
	
	 
-> Syntax for creating your own Directive 
    
    var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
    app.directive("w3TestDirective", function() {
    return {
              restrict : "A",
              template : " ",
            };
          });	
  
  4. Model
  
 ->  The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
 
 ->  Syntax for using Model
 
    Name: <input ng-model="name">

    var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
    app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.name = "John Doe";
});

-> The ng-model directive adds/removes the following classes, according to the status of the form field:

	ng-empty
	ng-not-empty
	ng-touched
	ng-untouched
	ng-invalid
	ng-dirty
	ng-pending
	ng-pristine

-> The ng-model directive provides a two-way binding between the model and the view.
     - Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.
       When data in the model changes, the view reflects the change, and when data in the
	   view changes,the model is updated as well. This happens immediately and automatically,
	   which makes sure that the model and the view is updated at all times.

  5. Data Binding
  
 -> Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.

  6. Controllers
  
 ->  AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications.
 
 -> The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.

 -> A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor.
 
 -> Syntax is 
 
    var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
    app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.firstName = "John";
    $scope.lastName = "Doe";
    });
	
    where

	The AngularJS application is defined by  ng-app="myApp". The application runs inside div.

	The ng-controller="myCtrl" attribute is an AngularJS directive. It defines a controller.

	The myCtrl function is a JavaScript function.

	AngularJS will invoke the controller with a $scope object.

	In AngularJS, $scope is the application object (the owner of application variables and functions).

	The controller creates two properties (variables) in the scope (firstName and lastName).

	The ng-model directives bind the input fields to the controller properties (firstName and lastName).
	
7. Scope

-> The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).

-> The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.

-> The scope is available for both the view and the controller.

8. Filters

-> Filters can be added in AngularJS to format data.

-> AngularJS provides filters to transform data:

   currency Format a number to a currency format.
   date Format a date to a specified format.
   filter Select a subset of items from an array.
   json Format an object to a JSON string.
   limitTo Limits an array/string, into a specified number of elements/characters.
   lowercase Format a string to lower case.
   number Format a number to a string.
   orderBy Orders an array by an expression.
   uppercase Format a string to upper case.
   
-> Syntax is The name is {{ lastName | lowercase }}

9. Routing

-> If you want to navigate to different pages in your application, but you also want the application 
   to be a SPA (Single Page Application) with no page reloading, you can use the ngRoute module.
   
-> Syntax is 
               var app = angular.module("myApp", ["ngRoute"]);
               app.config(function($routeProvider) {
			   $routeProvider
			   .when("/", {
               templateUrl : "main.htm"
                          })
               .when("/red", {
               templateUrl : "red.htm"
               })
               .when("/green", {
               templateUrl : "green.htm"
			   controller : "parisCtrl"
               })
               .when("/blue", {
               templateUrl : "blue.htm"
			   .otherwise({
               template : "Nothing has been selected"
			   
               });
               });
			   app.controller("parisCtrl", function ($scope) {
               $scope.msg = "I love Paris";
10. Services

->In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.

->AngularJS has about 30 built-in services.

-> AngularJS provides many inbuilt services for example, $https:, $route, $window, $location etc.

->AngularJS constantly supervises your application, and for it to handle changes and events properly, 
AngularJS prefers that you use the $location service instead of the window.location object.

-> There are two ways to create a service.
		factory
		service

-> Using factory method
Using factory method, we first define a factory and then assign method to it.

var mainApp = angular.module("mainApp", []);
mainApp.factory('MathService', function() {
   var factory = {};
   
   factory.multiply = function(a, b) {
      return a * b
   }
   
   return factory;
}); 

-> Using service method
Using service method, we define a service and then assign method to it. We've also injected an already available service to it.

mainApp.service('CalcService', function(MathService){
   this.square = function(a) {
      return MathService.multiply(a,a);
   }
});

 
11. Tables

-> Table data is normally repeatable by nature. ng-repeat directive can be used to draw table easily.

->syntax is 
   
    ng-repeat = "subject in student.subjects"
          {{ subject.name }}
          {{ subject.marks }}
		  
12. HTML DOM

-> Following directives can be used to bind application data to attributes of HTML DOM Elements.

Sr.No.	Name	   Description
1	  ng-disabled	disables a given control.
2	  ng-show	    shows a given control.
3	  ng-hide	    hides a given control.
4	  ng-click	    represents a AngularJS click event.
